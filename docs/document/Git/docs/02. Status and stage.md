# Status and stage

## Version of a file

When a file is added to stage, it was granted with new a version(or its status has been recorded by the stage shall we say).
Before you add the file to the stage, its status won't be recorded, so its version is none but the status is `modified` or something.

## Stage

Stage is a place where some files of a version are indexed to be committed.

## Status

Every version of a file has a status, once you modified a file, the status changed. The file comparing to the version in stage, they are different. They are snapshots!

- status can be `unstaged`, `staged`, `modified`

## Add files to stage

Use `git add <files>` to add single or multiple files into stage. `<files>` can be a **pattern** such like `*.md`, and can be multiple files `1.md, 2.cs`.

- Do not add large binary files into stage! Git is not suitable for indexing binary files and takes large storage!

## Check status of files

Use `git status` to check status of all files.
