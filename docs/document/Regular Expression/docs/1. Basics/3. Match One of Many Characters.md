# Match One of Many Characters

## Character class

Create a *character class* to match one occurrence inside a `[]`

```regex
c[ae]l[ae]nd[ae]r
```

## Range operator

Create a certain range using `-`

Match one of hexadecimal characters:

```regex
[a-fA-F0-9]
```

> Reversed range like `[f-a]` are not valid

## Negation operator

Negate a range using leading `^`

Match Non-hexadecimal characters:

```regex
[^a-fA-F0-9]
```

## Escape inside character class

There's four special characters may need to be escaped:

- `-` range operator
- `^` negation operator
- `[` and `]` start and end of character class

For any character that are not one of above, is not required to be escaped:

```regex
[$()*+.?{|]
```

For `^`s not act as negation are not required to be escaped:

```regex
[a-f^A-F\^0-9]
```

Also for `-` and `[`/`]`

:::hint
It's recommended to always escape metacharacters in character classes

## Shorthand character classes

- `\d` matches any single *digit*, equivalent to `[\d]` and `[0-9]`
- `\D` matches any character that is *not a digit*, equivalent to `[^\d]` and `[^0-9]`
- `\w` matches any *word character*, equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`
- `\W` matches any character that is *not a word character*, equivalent to `[^\w]`
- `\s` matches any *whitespace character*, like tabs, spaces, line breaks.
- `\S` matches any character that is *not a whitespace character*

> In `.NET`, `\w` matches not only `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`, it also includes other letters like Cyrillic and Thai.
> `\s` also matches whitespace characters in Unicode in `.NET` and `JavaScript`
