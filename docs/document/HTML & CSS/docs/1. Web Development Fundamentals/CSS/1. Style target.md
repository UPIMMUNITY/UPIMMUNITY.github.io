# Style Selector

## Class selector

Use `.` to select a element with class.

Synopsis: `[<parent_pattern>].<class_name>{}`

```css
.class_name {

}
/* matches to all paragraph with the class */
p.class_name {

}
```

> [!WARNING]
> Space matters in selector.
> See: [Recusive child selector](#Recusive-child-selector) 

```css
/* matches recursive children with class `foo` after a paragraph */
p .foo {

}
/* matches paragraph with class `foo` */
p.foo {

}
```

## Attribute selector

```css
/* matches to all element have `href` attribute */
[href] {
  color: blue;
}
/* matches to all anchors have `href` attribute */
a[href] {
  color: blue;
}
```
### Exact match

```css
/* matches all anchors have the exact value */
a[href="foo.com"] {
}
```

### Contains operator

```css
/* matches all anchors contains the value */
a[href*="foo"] {
  color: blue;
}
```

### Starts-with operator

```css
/* matches all anchors starts with the value */
a[href^="https"] {
  color: blue;
}
```

### Ends-with operator

```css
/* matches all anchors ends with the value */
a[href$=".com"] {
  color: blue;
}
```

### Operator composition

One can combine different patterns:

```css
[href$=".com"][href^="https"] {

}
```
## Relational selector

> [!TIP]
> Use `*` to represent an all pattern

### Recusive child selector

Use a space to represent recursive child selection.

Synopsis: `<parent_pattern> <child_pattern> {}`

```css
/* matches to all anchors of paragraph recursively */
p a {

}
```

### Direct child selector

Use `>` to represent direct child selection.

Synopsis: `<parent_pattern> > <child_pattern> {}`

```css
/* matches to all first level anchors under a  paragraph recursively */
p > a {

}
```

### Adjacent sibling selector

Use `+` to represent a direct neighbor of certain pattern.

Synopsis: `<parent_pattern> + <child_pattern> {}`

```css
/* matches a achor right after paragraph */
p + a {

}
```

```html
<p>foo</p>
<a></a> <!-- matched! --> <!-- [!code highlight]  -->
<a></a> <!-- not matched --> <!-- [!code error]  -->
```

### General sibling selector

Use `~` to represent a direct neighbor of certain pattern.

Synopsis: `<parent_pattern> ~ <child_pattern> {}`

```css
/* matches all achors right after paragraph */
p ~ a {

}
```

```html
<p>foo</p>
<a></a> <!-- matched! --> <!-- [!code highlight]  -->
<a></a> <!-- matched! --> <!-- [!code highlight]  -->
```

## Pseudo class

Pseudo classes are some built in pattern from css for selecting in some trivial scenarios.
Pseudo classes starts with `:`, can be used as a single pattern too just like `.`

### First/Last child

- `:first-child`: selects first child of a parent, it's surely a **first** version of `>`
- `:first-of-type`: selects first children of a parent having the distinct tag name.
