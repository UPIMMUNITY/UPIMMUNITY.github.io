# Overview

- Integrated with `.NET`
Reuse almost any type in `.NET`.
- Dynamic typing
Powershell adds extra attribute and properties on dotnet types to enhance experience.
- Case insensitive
All language syntax, pattern syntax and even strings are case-insensitive.
(There's exception for file system on non-Windows platform)
- Everything is object, more than plain text in shell.
Powershell formats the object value as a table if the object is not a primitive type.
For primitive type, `Tostring()` will be used instead.
- Always handle both array and singular object.
A powershell cmdlet always accepts an array or an single object as input parameter.
And returns the result as an array or an object too.
