## Terminology

Powershell has its own terminologies besides other shells like bash.
It's a shell integrated with .NET, it's not a independent platform.

- `cmdlet`: builtin utils inside powershell, implemented using other languages like `C#`.
- `function`: a command implemented using powershell language itself.
- `application`: external executables.
